[01:24.86] You're ruling the way that I move
[01:30.19] You take my air
[01:36.72] You show me how deep love can be
[01:52.72] 
[02:11.99] You're ruling the way that I move
[02:17.19] And I breathe your air
[02:24.06] You only can rescue me
[02:29.33] This is my prayer
[02:37.83] 
[03:00.13] I cherish the day
[03:03.14] I won't go astray
